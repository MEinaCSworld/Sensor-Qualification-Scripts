# Sensor-Qualification-Scripts
This holds the scripts I have used to qualify sensors for the robotics projects I am working on.

So far, the sensors I have qualified are:
1. HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Distance Sensor
2. Infrared Tachometer
3. Hall Sensor Tachometer (failed to be reproducible.

This repo only holds the ultrasonic distance sensor for now but will be updated with more sensors soon!
